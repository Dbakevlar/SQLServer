SQL Server Support Scripts  
By Kellyn Gorman

This repository contains a collection of SQL Server scripts created and curated by Kellyn Gorman. These scripts are intended to help database administrators and developers with everyday troubleshooting, performance tuning, and system monitoring.

Contents include:
- Performance diagnostics
- Index usage and maintenance
- Wait stats and bottleneck analysis
- Query execution review
- Backup and restore checks
- Space usage and growth trends

How to Use:
- Open any script in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Review the comments and modify parameters as needed
- Run the script against your target SQL Server database

These scripts are designed to work with SQL Server 2016 and later, though most have been with me since my early days with SQL Server 7.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome. Please open an issue in the GitHub repository with any questions or ideas.

Use these scripts at your own risk and always test in a non-production environment first.
